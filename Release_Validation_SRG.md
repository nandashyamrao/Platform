# 🚀 Automating Release Validation with Observability-Based Scorecarding

Ensuring system stability after deployments is crucial, whether introducing a new release or modifying configurations. **Dynatrace Site Reliability Guardian** 🛡️ provides a structured approach to automating release validation, helping teams monitor critical objectives across infrastructure, services, security, and more. Below is an overview of its functionality and best practices.

## 🔍 Overview of Dynatrace Site Reliability Guardian
- ✅ Designed to automate release validation by evaluating key metrics post-deployment.
- 🎯 Provides **predefined templates** to quickly establish monitoring for Kubernetes workloads, security gates, and other objectives.
- 🔧 Allows customization by defining additional validation criteria specific to the organization’s needs.

## 🔥 Current Challenges and Resolutions

### 1. **❌ High Error Rates Post-Deployment**
   - **Challenge**: Increased error logs after a deployment may indicate an issue with the new release.
   - **Resolution**: Utilize the **Container Logs** metric in Guardian to detect abnormal error spikes and rollback if necessary.

### 2. **🚨 Service Downtime and Unavailability**
   - **Challenge**: Deployments may lead to service unavailability or increased HTTP 500 errors.
   - **Resolution**: Leverage **Service Availability** monitoring to track failed requests and take proactive measures before user impact.

### 3. **🐢 Slow Application Performance After Deployment**
   - **Challenge**: Response times of critical API endpoints may degrade post-deployment.
   - **Resolution**: **Service Performance** validation ensures API response times remain within acceptable thresholds.

### 4. **🔄 Deployment Rollbacks and Failures**
   - **Challenge**: Rolling updates may not maintain the same throughput as before.
   - **Resolution**: **Service Throughput** checks validate if request volume is consistent post-deployment, preventing disruptions.

### 5. **🤖 Lack of Automated Validation and Monitoring**
   - **Challenge**: Manual checks and validations can delay releases and introduce errors.
   - **Resolution**: **Synthetic Availability** automates testing to ensure consistent application behavior.

### 6. **📊 Ineffective Observability Metrics Management**
   - **Challenge**: Siloed monitoring tools make it difficult to correlate observability metrics across deployments.
   - **Resolution**: **Centralized Guardian** approach consolidates validation across logs, metrics, and traces for unified visibility.

## 🏆 Best Practices for Release Validation
- 📌 **Custom Objectives**: Move beyond default templates by adding custom validation checks.
- 📊 **Multi-Dimensional Monitoring**: Track application performance across multiple versions.
- 📅 **Historical Validation**: Maintain an execution history to compare deployments over time.

## 📈 Key Observability Metrics Used
### 1. **📄 Container Logs**
   - 📝 Monitors the ratio of error/warning logs to total logs.
   - 🚨 Ensures no unexpected spike in errors post-deployment.

### 2. **📦 Pod Availability**
   - 🔄 Measures the ratio of desired vs. active pods in Kubernetes.
   - 🟢 Ensures successful pod deployments without failures.

### 3. **⚠️ Service Availability**
   - ❌ Tracks HTTP failures (e.g., 500 errors).
   - ✅ Ensures system stability by detecting abnormal failure rates.

### 4. **⚡ Service Performance**
   - ⏳ Ensures API endpoints and UI interactions maintain response times within set thresholds.
   - 🚀 Helps detect performance degradation after deployments.

### 5. **🔬 Synthetic Availability**
   - 🤖 Uses synthetic tests to validate uptime and functionality after deployments.

### 6. **📊 Service Throughput**
   - 🔁 Ensures that the number of processed requests remains stable before and after deployment.
   - 🏗️ Detects potential bottlenecks in rolling updates.

## 🔧 Implementation and Customization
- 📜 **Notebook with Queries**: Dynatrace provides a parameterized notebook containing queries for different validation metrics.
- 🏗️ **Backstage Integration**: Uses an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) like Backstage for unique component identification.
- 🔀 **Variable Customization**: Enables configuring queries dynamically using project names, owners, and stages.

## 🔔 Automation and Notifications
- 🏷️ **Tagging Best Practices**: Assign relevant metadata to Guardians (e.g., project, team, stage) for better organization.
- 🔄 **Workflow Triggers**: Notifications can be sent when a Guardian completes execution.
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Integration**: Results can be automatically linked to CI/CD workflows for continuous validation.

## 🌐 Centralized Guardian for Deployment Health Checks
- A **central Guardian** can validate deployments by monitoring:
  - 📑 Log generation
  - 📊 Metric ingestion in Dynatrace
  - 🔍 Request and trace capturing
- 🛡️ It can be extended to security events and additional telemetry sources.

## 🛠️ Developer-Friendly Insights
- 🎛️ **Backstage Integration**: Developers can access Guardian results directly in Backstage.
- 🔗 **Git Commit Integration**: Guardian results can be linked to Git workflows for visibility.
- 🧐 **Root Cause Analysis**: Quickly identify failures, such as service unavailability or pod failures.



## ✅ Final Takeaways
- 🚀 **Leverage Guardian Templates** for a quick start.
- 🛠️ **Customize validation metrics** to fit your system’s requirements.
- 🔄 **Automate notifications and CI/CD workflows** to integrate observability into DevOps processes.
- 🏗️ **Use a centralized validation approach** to confirm all deployments are healthy.
- 🖥️ **Integrate with Backstage and Git** for improved developer workflow efficiency.

This methodology ensures **continuous observability and reliability** throughout the deployment lifecycle. 🎯
