# **Backstage – Detailed Guide**

## **🔹 What is Backstage?**
Backstage is an **open-source developer portal** created by **Spotify** that helps organizations **centralize tools, documentation, CI/CD pipelines, service catalogs, and observability data** into a **single, self-service platform**.

✅ **Think of it as an internal developer hub that brings all software lifecycle tools into one place.**

---

## **🔹 Key Features of Backstage**
| **Feature** | **What It Does** | **Benefit** |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| 🏗 **Service Catalog** | Lists all internal microservices & dependencies | Developers can find services easily |
| 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines** | Integrates with GitLab, Jenkins, GitHub Actions | **Monitor deployments & pipeline status** |
| 🔍 **Observability & Monitoring** | Displays logs, traces, and metrics from Dynatrace, Prometheus, etc. | **Faster debugging & root cause analysis** |
| 📜 **Documentation Hub** | Centralizes all internal docs (Markdown, Confluence, etc.) | No more searching multiple places |
| 🔧 **Plugins & Integrations** | Supports plugins for Kubernetes, APIs, Terraform, etc. | Extensible for any use case |
| 📢 **Self-Service for Developers** | Enables developers to **self-manage services, deployments, and monitoring** | **Reduces dependency on Ops teams** |

---

## **🔹 Why Was Backstage Created?**
Before Backstage, **developers had to switch between multiple tools** for monitoring, deployments, API documentation, and logs.  
This led to **fragmented workflows, slower debugging, and unnecessary overhead**.

✅ **Backstage was built to solve this by:**  
- Providing **a single pane of glass** for all **developer tools & services**.  
- Reducing **onboarding time for new engineers** by making documentation & service ownership clear.  
- Enabling **self-service infrastructure management** without needing Ops/SRE intervention.  

🚀 **The goal:** Make software development & operations seamless with an **internal developer portal**.

---

## **🔹 How Does Backstage Work?**
Backstage is structured around **core building blocks** that enable teams to **manage software at scale**.

### **1️⃣ Backstage Service Catalog**
The **Service Catalog** is the heart of Backstage, listing **all internal microservices, APIs, libraries, and dependencies**.

📌 **Example Backstage YAML to Register a Service:**
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-service
  description: "Microservice for handling user authentication"
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
    dynatrace.com/service-id: "my-service-dynatrace-id"
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-dev
```

✅ **Developers can now see:**  
- Who owns the service  
- Which APIs & dependencies it interacts with  
- Observability metrics from Dynatrace/Prometheus  

---

### **2️⃣ Backstage CI/CD Pipelines**
Backstage integrates with **GitLab, Jenkins, GitHub Actions**, and other CI/CD tools to **track deployments, builds, and releases**.

📌 **Example Backstage YAML for CI/CD Integration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-dev
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: my-org/my-app
    ci.github.com/build-status: "https://github.com/my-org/my-app/actions"
```

✅ **Developers can now track:**  
- Build & deployment history  
- Pipeline failures and logs  
- Which version is running in production  

---

### **3️⃣ Observability in Backstage**
Backstage supports **logging, monitoring, and tracing integrations** with tools like **Dynatrace, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Elastic**.

📌 **Example Backstage YAML for Dynatrace Integration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-dev
  links:
    - url: "https://your-dynatrace-env.live.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/logs/my-service"
      title: "Dynatrace Logs"
      icon: "logs"
    - url: "https://your-dynatrace-env.live.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/tracing/my-service"
      title: "Dynatrace Tracing"
      icon: "trace"
    - url: "https://your-dynatrace-env.live.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/problems"
      title: "Dynatrace AI Problems"
      icon: "alert"
```

✅ **Developers can now:**  
- See real-time **logs & traces** without leaving Backstage  
- Access **AI-powered issue detection from Dynatrace**  
- Debug application issues faster  

---

### **4️⃣ Backstage Documentation Hub**
Backstage **centralizes all technical documentation** in one place using **TechDocs**.

📌 **Example TechDocs Registration in Backstage:**
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-dev
```

✅ **Developers no longer need to search Confluence, Google Docs, or Notion.**  
Everything is accessible **inside Backstage.**  

---

### **5️⃣ Extending Backstage with Plugins**
Backstage supports **custom plugins** for:  
- **Kubernetes monitoring** (`@backstage/plugin-kubernetes`)  
- **Terraform Infrastructure tracking** (`@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-terraform`)  
- **Secrets Management** (`@backstage/plugin-hashicorp-vault`)  
- **Cost Monitoring** (`@backstage/plugin-cost-insights`)  

📌 **Example: Adding Kubernetes Plugin to Backstage:**
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: team-dev
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/cluster: my-k8s-cluster
```

✅ **Now, developers can view Kubernetes deployments directly in Backstage!**
