# **Integrating Dynatrace with Backstage in MERNA**  

## **1️⃣ Overview**  
This document outlines how Dynatrace can be integrated into Backstage within MERNA, covering:  
- **Unified observability in Backstage**  
- **Live service health dashboards**  
- **GitLab CI/CD traceability**  
- **Self-service monitoring & alerts**  
- **Incident visibility & auto-remediation**  

---  

## **2️⃣ Benefits of Dynatrace Integration with Backstage**  

### **✅ 1. Unified Observability in Developer Workflows**  
- Developers can **see real-time application health, logs, traces, and metrics** in one place.  
- No need to switch between **Dynatrace dashboards and Backstage**—observability data is embedded directly.  
- **Example:** A team deploying a service can see Dynatrace alerts & metrics **without leaving Backstage**.  

---  

### **✅ 2. Live Service Health Dashboards in Backstage**  
- Display **real-time application performance and error rates** from Dynatrace.  
- Embed **Dynatrace service status, SLO tracking, and key metrics** inside Backstage.  
- **Example:** A Backstage service catalog page can show **latency, error rate, and transaction volumes** for a microservice.  

📌 **Example Backstage YAML for Dynatrace Integration:**  
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: service
  owner: team-xyz
  lifecycle: production
  links:
    - url: "https://dynatrace.company.com/dashboard/my-app"
      title: "Dynatrace Service Dashboard"
      icon: "monitor"
```
✅ **Clicking the link takes developers to the exact service dashboard in Dynatrace.**  

---  

### **✅ 3. GitLab CI/CD Traceability**  
- Link **GitLab pipelines to Dynatrace traces** to see the impact of deployments.  
- Developers can **trace a bad deployment to performance issues** instantly.  
- **Example:** A Backstage CI/CD page can show **which Git commit caused a Dynatrace alert**.  

📌 **Example Backstage Plugin Configuration for GitLab & Dynatrace:**  
```yaml
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: service
  owner: team-xyz
  lifecycle: production
  links:
    - url: "https://gitlab.com/my-org/my-app/pipelines"
      title: "GitLab Pipeline"
      icon: "gitlab"
    - url: "https://dynatrace.company.com/traces/my-app"
      title: "Dynatrace Traces"
      icon: "trace"
```
✅ **Developers can quickly correlate code changes with application performance.**  

---  

### **✅ 4. Self-Service Monitoring & Alerts**  
- Developers can **define Dynatrace alerts directly from Backstage** without needing admin access.  
- Teams can **self-service their own dashboards, alerts, and SLOs** in Dynatrace.  
- **Example:** A Backstage UI form can let developers configure **Dynatrace monitoring rules** for their service.  

📌 **Example Backstage Alert Definition:**  
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: high-latency-warning
spec:
  type: performance
  description: "Alert if service latency > 500ms"
  conditions:
    - metric: "response.time"
      threshold: 500
      operator: "greater_than"
  actions:
    - notify: "team-xyz@company.com"
    - trigger: "rollback_pipeline"
```
✅ **Developers can manage observability **without needing direct Dynatrace admin access**.  

---  

### **✅ 5. Incident & Auto-Remediation Visibility**  
- Backstage can show **Dynatrace Davis AI incidents** so teams can take action faster.  
- Incidents can trigger **automated rollbacks, scaling, or Kubernetes healing.**  
- **Example:** A Backstage "Incidents" page can show active **Dynatrace Davis AI problems** with links to resolutions.  

📌 **Example Backstage Incident Panel:**  
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Problem
metadata:
  name: high-cpu-usage
spec:
  type: performance
  description: "CPU utilization above 90% for 5 minutes"
  actions:
    - notify: "on-call-sre@company.com"
    - trigger: "scale-up-kubernetes"
```
✅ **Dynatrace AI-powered problem detection can be surfaced directly inside Backstage.**
