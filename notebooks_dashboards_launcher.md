## **📌 Comparison of Notebooks, Dashboards, and Launcher App**  

| **Feature** | **Notebooks** 📝 | **Dashboards** 📊 | **Launcher App** 🚀 |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Used for **ad-hoc analysis** with DQL, allowing flexible queries and data exploration. | Used for **monitoring KPIs**, visualizing trends, and sharing insights across teams. | Provides **pre-built observability workflows, automation, and deeper integrations.** |
| **Interactivity** | Fully interactive – allows you to **write queries, modify results, and iterate dynamically.** | **Limited interactivity** – mostly used for **visualization** with static widgets. | **Highly interactive** – enables users to **trigger actions, navigate across services, and automate workflows.** |
| **Query Execution** | Requires **manual query writing** (DQL). | Uses **saved queries** to update widgets. | **No manual queries needed** – integrates with dashboards, logs, and events automatically. |
| **Visualization** | Supports **charts, tables, and custom visualizations.** | Provides **predefined widgets like time-series graphs, bar charts, and tables.** | Uses **dynamic UI components** to provide **richer experiences (interactive insights, automated suggestions, and drill-downs).** |
| **Real-time Data** | Can execute **on-demand queries** for logs, metrics, and traces. | Updates based on **dashboard refresh intervals** (e.g., every 5 minutes). | Uses **real-time API integration** to **fetch, process, and display the latest data dynamically.** |
| **Collaboration** | Best for **data analysts & SREs** who want **flexible data exploration.** | Best for **executives & engineers** who need **a quick summary view of performance.** | Best for **operators & incident response teams** who need **guided actions & automation.** |
| **Customization** | Highly customizable – supports **notebooks with markdown, queries, and inline visualizations.** | **Limited customization** – prebuilt **widgets** with limited DQL options. | **Extensive customization** – integrates **Dynatrace services, external APIs, and automation workflows.** |
| **Automation & Actions** | No automation – requires **manual query execution.** | No built-in automation – requires **manual interaction.** | **Built-in automation** – can trigger **remediation actions, integrate with alerts, and provide guided workflows.** |

### **📌 Summary**  

| **If You Use Only Notebooks** 📝 | **If You Use Only Dashboards** 📊 | **If You Use Dynatrace Launcher** 🚀 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Requires **manual queries** for every analysis. | Provides **static monitoring**, not interactive troubleshooting. | **Pre-built workflows** automate insights and actions. |
| Best for **investigating issues**, not continuous monitoring. | Great for **visual summaries**, but lacks deep analysis. | **Combines analysis, monitoring, and automation** in one interface. |
| No **direct action execution** – only displays results. | No **real-time automation** – just shows data trends. | **Can trigger alerts, automations, and guided workflows.** |

## **📌 Example Workflow: Integrating Notebooks, Dashboards, and Launcher**  

### **🚀 Scenario: Diagnosing High Response Times in an Application**  

#### **1️⃣ Step 1: Investigate the Issue in a Notebook**  
- An **SRE or engineer** opens a **Dynatrace Notebook** to explore service performance.  
- Runs the following **DQL query** to analyze high response times:  

```dql
timeseries { avgResponseTime = avg(dt.service.request.duration) }, by: { dt.entity.service }
filter avgResponseTime > 500
```  

✅ **Findings:** The **auth-service** has a high response time (>500ms).  

---  

#### **2️⃣ Step 2: Check the Dashboard for a Broader View**  
- The **SRE switches to the Dashboard** to see response time trends.  
- The **Dashboard widget** shows:  
  - **Response time spikes at peak traffic hours.**  
  - **Increased error rates correlated with response time spikes.**  

✅ **Findings:** High response times **align with an increase in HTTP 500 errors.**  

---  

#### **3️⃣ Step 3: Use Launcher to Trigger an Investigation**  
- The **SRE opens the Launcher App** and selects **“Investigate High Response Times”** workflow.  
- The Launcher automatically:  
  1️⃣ **Runs additional queries** (logs + traces) to correlate errors with slow requests.  
  2️⃣ **Suggests root causes** (e.g., database latency, overloaded instances).  
  3️⃣ **Provides remediation options**, such as:  
     - Restarting affected pods.  
     - Scaling the service automatically.  
     - Triggering an alert for further monitoring.  

✅ **Outcome:** The **auth-service database is slow**, and **scaling up the database resolves the issue.**

## **📌 How Launcher Fills the Gap**  

| **Task** | **Notebook** 📝 | **Dashboard** 📊 | **Launcher App** 🚀 |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Exploring Data with Queries** | ✅ Manual Query Execution | ❌ Not Possible | ✅ Prebuilt Queries |
| **Visualizing Trends** | ✅ Limited | ✅ Strong Visualization | ✅ Dynamic UI |
| **Automating Actions** | ❌ No Automation | ❌ No Automation | ✅ Can Trigger Actions |
| **Correlating Logs, Metrics, & Traces** | ✅ Possible (Manually) | ❌ Not Possible | ✅ Automatic |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | ❌ Requires Manual Investigation | ❌ Requires Switching Views | ✅ Guided Troubleshooting |

## **🎯 Final Takeaways**  

| **Use Case** | **Recommended Tool** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Quick Data Exploration** | Use **Notebooks** 📝 |
| **Monitoring Trends & KPIs** | Use **Dashboards** 📊 |
| **Automated Analysis & Actions** | Use **Launcher** 🚀 |
