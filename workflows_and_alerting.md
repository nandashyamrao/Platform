Dynatrace Alerting Workflow in Detail
Workflow Summary
 * Data Collection: OneAgent gathers data from your environment.
 * Anomaly Detection: Davis AI analyzes data and detects deviations.
 * Problem Creation: Dynatrace creates a problem event.
 * Root Cause Analysis: Davis AI determines the root cause.
 * Alerting: Dynatrace sends alerts based on alerting profiles.
 * Remediation: Manual or automated remediation actions are taken.
 * Problem Resolution: The problem is resolved and closed.
Detailed Explanation of Each Step
1. Data Collection
 * How it's done:
   * Dynatrace's OneAgent is the core data collector. It's a lightweight software agent that's deployed on every host, virtual machine, container, and cloud instance in your environment.
   * OneAgent automatically discovers all the components of your application and infrastructure, including services, processes, databases, and network devices.
   * It then collects a wide range of performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, response times, error rates, and network traffic.
   * In addition to metrics, OneAgent also captures distributed traces, which provide end-to-end visibility into transactions across your entire application stack.
   * Log data is also collected, enabling Dynatrace to correlate log events with performance metrics and traces.
   * Essentially, oneAgent is constantly gathering data, and sending it back to the Dynatrace platform.
2. Anomaly Detection
 * How it's done:
   * Dynatrace's AI engine, Davis, plays a crucial role in anomaly detection.
   * Davis uses machine learning algorithms to establish baselines for normal behavior. These baselines are dynamic and adapt to changes in your environment.
   * Davis continuously analyzes the collected data and compares it to the established baselines.
   * When Davis detects a significant deviation from the baseline, it flags it as an anomaly.
   * This process allows Dynatrace to identify unusual patterns and potential problems before they impact users.
3. Problem Creation
 * How it's done:
   * When Davis detects an anomaly that exceeds a certain threshold, or when a predefined event or SLO violation occurs, Dynatrace creates a "problem."
   * A problem represents a detected issue that requires attention.
   * Dynatrace automatically generates a problem ticket that contains detailed information about the issue, including the affected components, the time of occurrence, and the severity level.
   * So in essence, the problem creation is the system logging that there is a deviation from the expected norm.
4. Root Cause Analysis
 * How it's done:
   * Davis performs automated root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the problem.
   * It analyzes the collected data, including metrics, traces, and logs, to pinpoint the specific component or service that's responsible for the issue.
   * Dynatrace's Smartscape provides a real-time dependency map of your environment, which helps Davis understand the relationships between different components.
   * Davis uses causal analysis to trace the problem back to its origin, even in complex, distributed environments.
   * This is a very powerful function of Dynatrace, as it doesn't just tell you something is wrong, it attempts to tell you exactly why.
5. Alerting
 * How it's done:
   * Dynatrace uses alerting profiles to determine when and how to send notifications.
   * Alerting profiles define the conditions that trigger alerts, the severity levels, and the notification channels.
   * Dynatrace supports a variety of notification channels, including email, PagerDuty, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.
   * When a problem is created, Dynatrace sends notifications to the designated recipients through the configured channels.
   * This step is how the people who need to know about the problem, are informed.
6. Remediation
 * How it's done:
   * Dynatrace provides various tools and integrations to help you remediate problems.
   * Runbooks can be linked to problems, providing step-by-step instructions for resolving the issue.
   * Dynatrace integrates with automation tools, enabling auto-remediation of common problems.
   * Integrations with ITSM tools like ServiceNow allow for seamless incident management.
   * This step is where the problem gets fixed, either by automatic systems, or by human intervention.
7. Problem Resolution
 * How it's done:
   * Once the problem has been resolved, it's marked as closed in Dynatrace.
   * Dynatrace maintains a history of all problems, which can be used for analysis and reporting.
   * Closing the problem, cleans up the alerts, and logs that the issue has been resolved.
   * This step is the final logging of the issue being completed.
